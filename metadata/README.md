# Description for metadata folder

- `metadata/WGS/`: Meta table retrieved from source studies. In my WGS analysis, only Dog10K project is used.

- `metadata/backup_vcf_file.list`: List of files from runs before 2021. Used in `scripts/breed_prediction/combine_MAF.sh`.

- `metadata/data_collection_new_renamed.csv`: List of new WES samples that not included in the original publication. Sample names are fixed for duplicates across Bioprojects.

- `metadata/data_collection_old.csv`: List of WES samples included in the original publication. Retrieved from supplementary table.

- `metadata/data_new_readlength.csv`: Noting the read length of each Bioproject in new datasets. Required to run QC.

- `metadata/dataset_sum.xlsx`: Information for new Bioprojects.

- `metadata/Pass_QC_Final_Total_withGene_Burair_Filtering4_VAF_Mutect_orientBiasModified_04_02.txt`: List of known somatic mutations. Used in phylogenetic pipeline.

- `metadata/this_wunpaired_meta.csv`: Reformatted meta table for old + new WES samples. Generated by `scripts/breed_prediction/combine_MAF.sh`, used in following analysis by phylogenetic pipeline.

- `metadata/vcf_file_list.txt`: List of VCF files (the complete WES dataset). Generated by `scripts/breed_prediction/combine_MAF.sh`, used in following analysis by phylogenetic pipeline.
