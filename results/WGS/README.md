## Figures
- `results/WGS/breeds_heatmap_wgsmain_CDS_beforeQC4567.png` and `results/WGS/breeds_heatmap_wgsmain_CDS_beforeQC9999.png`: The heatmap shows the clustering of XX dogs, using variant allele frequency (VAF) values of the XX breed-specific germline base substitution and small indel variants. These variants were discovered with the WGS dataset generated by Dog10K project. The “Provided Breed” bar indicate the breed for each dog provided by the source study. 23 breeds with more than 10 dogs are selected for breed specific variants identification. Two figures are generated with seeds 4567 and 9999, respectively.
Figures are generated by running `scripts/wgs/breeds_joint_heatmap_beforeQC_wgs.R` interactively in RStudio.


- `results/WGS/breeds_heatmap_wgsassignment_beforeQC4567.png`: The heatmap shows the clustering of XX dogs, using variant allele frequency (VAF) values of the XX breed-specific germline base substitution and small indel variants. These variants were discovered with the WGS dataset generated by Dog10K project. The “Provided Breed” bar indicate the breed for each dog provided by the source study. 23 breeds with more than 10 dogs are selected for breed specific variants identification. Breed dogs other than 23 selected breeds are labeled as "Unknown/Missing". The figure is generated with seed 4567.

- `results/WGS/breeds_heatmap_mergemain_beforeQC.png` and `results/WGS/breeds_heatmap_mergeassignment_beforeQC.png`: The heatmap shows the clustering of XX dogs with breed provided, using variant allele frequency (VAF) values of the XX breed-specific germline base substitution and small indel variants. For dogs with paired Normal and Tumor samples, the normal one is used; Dogs only with Normal or Tumor samples are also used; Healthy dogs in Dog10K dataset are included. Breed specific variants are merged from WES and WGS indentified sets. The “Provided Breed” bar and the “Disease” bar respectively indicate the breed and tumor type of each dog provided by the source studies. 12 breeds from WES as well as 23 breeds from WGS with more than 10 dogs are selected for breed specific variants identification.
