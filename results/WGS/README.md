- `results/WGS/breeds_heatmap_wgsmain_CDS_beforeQC4567.png` and `results/WGS/breeds_heatmap_wgsmain_CDS_beforeQC9999.png`: The heatmap shows the clustering of XX dogs, using variant allele frequency (VAF) values of the XX breed-specific germline base substitution and small indel variants. These variants were discovered with the WGS dataset generated by Dog10K project. The “Provided Breed” bar indicate the breed for each dog provided by the source study. 23 breeds with more than 10 dogs are selected for breed specific variants identification.
